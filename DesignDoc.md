## To - Do (as of 2/22/24)
    ### Fighting Collisions
        - [x] create 'punch' prefab (look at attack prefab from fight fighters)
        - [x] implement 'fist' collision sprite
        - [] make sure fist moves with characters
        - [x] fist is hidden within collision body
        - [] if on impact with body sprite, move char health down by 10 pts
        - [] if player in 'block' state, fist has no effect on health
    ### Health Bar
        - [] deplete health bar based on collision of fist
        - [] health bar correctly decreases
        - [] if player health is 0 -> game over is true
    ### Stretch 
        - [] add Riley's narration based on random fight prompt
        - [] fix lag issues
